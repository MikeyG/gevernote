Geverpad (An Everpad Fork) (Preview)

I use Gentoo Linux with Gnome 3 ... I wanted an easy way to take notes across platforms and my systems. Evernote has been a workable solution for me, but I could not find a good Evernote Linux client. I tried out Everpad and it seemed to fit; however, it was not working correctly for me, so I went about changing things. I have decided to dump it in a new repository, so it is searchable which I could not do with a forked version online.

This is the first time I have played with python. It is neat, but I do not care much for it, no offense to anyone.
